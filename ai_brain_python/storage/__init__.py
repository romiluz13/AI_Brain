This module provides storage abstractions and implementations for the AI Brain system:
- MongoDB integration with Motor async driver
- Vector search capabilities
- Connection pooling and management
- CRUD operations for cognitive data
- Caching layer with Redis integration

The storage layer is designed to be high-performance and scalable,
supporting the real-time requirements of the cognitive systems.
